- 👋 Hi, I’m @Momo2364
- 👀 I’m interested in decoding email messages and files using an encryption tool that cannot be found anywhere 
- 🌱 I’m currently completely illiterate in computer science and I am overwhelmed by all the information I find in my unknown amount of gmail and email accounts 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on decoding and dealing with the clone program and root file that is being used in my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 phone system. AT&T and Samsung IT Support think that factory reset _password reset is the answer but it does not make a difference. The last time I tried to do a hard factory reset, it did not work
